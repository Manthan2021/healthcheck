-CaasStreamingMonitoring services-->is used to send daily health check report for services.
-At 3:30 we get daily health check report.for PROD,PRE,DEV enivornment.
-if you find that if one of the mails of CaasStreaming services is missing,go to openshift for DEV,PRE,PROD of which the mail you find missing.go to the "aws 
health check service" and check if the service is up and running using pods and check logs as well.if not up and running make it up.

-streaming services are always found in caas data ingestion paas.
-services starting with "aws" points to oracle where as without aws points to oracle.without aws conected to nuodb,hence scale down.need to check 
aws services only.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-After going for health check if any justcheck that services which are not reading the data are they up and running.if not report.
-if they are up just wait for three days including current day of not reading data,if they are even up you need to report for further checkups.
-last update column in the table shows,on which date is the data read by service.
-In every case make sure that the services must be up and running.
-all ok means all green,yellow three day buffer.
-kibana logs show the exceptions within the prod and it gives status of healthcheck.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
WHEN MORE THAN THREE DAYS DATA READING EXCEEDS.

 -acms aur non acms ka procedure alg alg h.
 -PCAS ->TOPIC->ORACLE(for non ACMS table).In this we need to check that the last data time recieved in PCAS is same as in oracle or not.
 we need to match CONTCURR column of the two,if both matches then the data is in sync else not.
-ACMS-contcurr colum check.
-Parameter-offset table check.
this way we check the real issue.
agar offset table me same date h,jo healthcheck ki table(mail wali) me pdi h....report.
-aur date alag h mtlb healthcheck report k bd data aa gya h.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-now I need to check the offset table,go to the service,then go to the entity,then check the offset table for that.check the table name,search that with in db.
-find groupid in yml files search that within db.check update date column.
-if the date is same as the date in report then report seniors,means if the updated date in table is not matching buffer criteria then report,
    if date is next to date then service has started reading the data.  
in report send complete  report and logs for kibana prod.
